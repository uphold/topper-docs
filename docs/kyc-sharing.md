# KYC sharing

To improve the onboarding experience, we provide a REST API that allows our business customers to share user KYC information directly with Topper.

By receiving KYC details, Topper can reduce the amount of information requested from users, resulting in a faster and smoother KYC process.

Currently, we support the following scopes: **email**, **profile**, **address**, **phone**, and **identity**.

For more details, see the [KYC sharing documentation](https://developer.uphold.com/rest-apis/core-api/kyc/introduction).

:::info
To use the KYC sharing feature, business customers need to complete a compliance check and be approved before gaining access.
