# Environments

## Sandbox

Topper app URL: `https://app.sandbox.topperpay.com/`

Topper's sandbox is an environment that simulates the live Topper production environment. The sandbox environment provides a space where you can test your integration with Topper without touching any live accounts, and without using any real funds.

The following card details can be used to force specific outcomes:

| Card number      | Outcome                 |
